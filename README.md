# Math_Game_V2
An enhanced version of my previous terminal math game in C#.

The added features are :
- A menu with options to choose between different operator games.
- You can enter your name and the console remembers it.
- Your games info and score are recorded in an history. Time of playing too.
- Refactored a bunch of methods to new files. Cleaned the code.
- A validation process so that an incorrect input format does not result in a crash.

  I added the published app in the Math_Game_V2_Published file.
